# Intro

I am a Software Engineer at [Snapp](https://www.snapp.ir). Also, I am student of undergraduate Computer Engineering at [Yazd University](https://yazd.ac.ir). I particularly have interest in (distributed) software systems, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Feel free to get in touch if you find me helpful or want to meet up.

# What I Do

At work, I am responsible for developing, designing, and maintaining microservices in an `event-driven` system, providing online taxi services for more than 40M users. In addition, I `research` new technologies to improve current `microservices`' maintainability and performance.
\
\
On the other hand, I'm interested in Machine Learning and Data Science, which have been visible throughout my undergraduate duration.
\
\
I did my AI lecture project on developing an intelligent agent to play the Othello game with a heuristic fitness function tuned by `genetic algorithms`. Doing so made me intrigued about learning new concepts such as Reinforcement Learning and `Deep Learning`. As a result, I am continuing what I have started and doing my undergraduate project on developing an agent for the Othello game using `Deep Reinforcement Learning`.
\
\
Through other lectures, I have done some data science work too. In the Information Retrieval lecture, I created a `tag recommender` that suggests the most related tags to the input tag based on questions in Stackoverflow. Or in the Computer Simulations lecture, I analyzed the behavior and characteristics of a graph representing relationships in social media, which falls under the category of `complex networks`.
\
\
To summarize, I love developing software systems and research in AI fields, including reinforcement learning, deep learning, and data science.


# Some history

- I studied Mathematics in high school. (I love math and physics so much!)
- At age 16, I started programming with Java.
- I like a future where robots and humans co-exist and galaxy exploration is a common thing.
- I explored many topics like Android, AI, Web Development, Microcontroller, Backend Development to find my interests.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.

# I like

- Running
- Space
- Photography
- Hiking
- Travel

# Fun facts

- I like to travel every city in Iran and someday visit every country in world.
- I love Sociology, Philosophy, Literature, and any abstract topic or concepts.

# I dream of

- always finding inspiration.
- being inspiration for younger people.
- going to space.
- doing better.
- a world without merge conflicts.
