# Intro

I am a Software Engineer at [Snapp](https://www.snapp.ir). Also, I am student of undergraduate Computer Engineering at [Yazd University](https://yazd.ac.ir). I particularly have interest in (distributed) software systems, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Feel free to get in touch if you find me helpful or want to meet up.

# What I Do

At work, I am responsible for creating, designing, and maintaining `microservices` in an `event driven system`, providing online taxi service for more than 40M+ users. In addition, I do some `research` for new technologies with goal of improving current microservices' maintainability and performance, and `mentoring` new joiner to get on their feet on their first days at the company.

On the other hand, I'm interested in `Machine Learning` and `Data Science`.

Concerning machine learning, after I finishing Artificial Intelligence Lecture' project, which was developing a smart agent to play the Othello board game with tuned fitness function by `genetic algorithms`, I got fascinated by machine learning and `deep learning`. As a result, I am continuing what I have started and doing my undergraduate project on developing an agent for the Othello game using `Deep Reinforcement Learning`.

In regard to data science, I have worked with `complex networks`, simulating relationships in online social media applications. Stackoverflow Tag Recommender would be another example, which I used questions data on stackoverflow to create a `recommender system` for suggestion questions tags based on association rules and similarities.


# Some history

- I studied Mathematics in high school. (I love math and physics so much!)
- At age 16, I started programming with Java.
- I like a future where robots and humans co-exist and galaxy exploration is a common thing.
- I explored many topics like Android, AI, Web Development, Microcontroller, Backend Development to find my interests.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
