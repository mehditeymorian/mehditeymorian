Also, I am student of undergraduate Computer Engineering at [Yazd University](https://yazd.ac.ir). I particularly have interest in (distributed) software systems, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Feel free to get in touch if you find me helpful or want to meet up.\n\n# What I Do\n\nAt work, I am responsible for developing, designing, and maintaining microservices in an `event-driven` system, providing online taxi services for more than 40M users. In addition, I `research` new technologies to improve current `microservices`' maintainability and performance.\n\\\n\\\nOn the other hand, I'm interested in Machine Learning and Data Science, which have been visible throughout my undergraduate duration.\n\\\n\\\nI did my AI lecture project on developing an intelligent agent to play the Othello game with a heuristic fitness function tuned by `genetic algorithms`. Doing so made me intrigued about learning new concepts such as Reinforcement Learning and `Deep Learning`. As a result, I am continuing what I have started and doing my undergraduate project on developing an agent for the Othello game using `Deep Reinforcement Learning`.\n\\\n\\\nThrough other lectures, I have done some data science work too. In the Information Retrieval lecture, I created a `tag recommender` that suggests the most related tags to the input tag based on questions in Stackoverflow. Or in the Computer Simulations lecture, I analyzed the behavior and characteristics of a graph representing relationships in social media, which falls under the category of `complex networks`.\n\\\n\\\nTo summarize, I love developing software systems and research in AI fields, including reinforcement learning, deep learning, and data science.\n\n\n# Some history\n\n- I studied Mathematics in high school. (I love math and physics so much!)\n- At age 16, I started programming with Java.\n- I like a future where robots and humans co-exist and galaxy exploration is a common thing.\n- I explored many topics like Android, AI, Web Development, Microcontroller, Backend Development to find my interests.\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Running\n- Space\n- Photography\n- Hiking\n- Travel\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I like to travel every city in Iran and someday visit every country in world.\n- I love Sociology, Philosophy, Literature, and any abstract topic or concepts.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- always finding inspiration.\n- being inspiration for younger people.\n- going to space.\n- doing better.\n- a world without merge conflicts.\n\n# Websites from people I admire\n\n- [Parham Alvani](https://1995parham.me/)\n- [Steve Francia](https://spf13.com/)\n\n\nIf we are friends and you feel like you belong on this list, you're probably right. I'm sorry I forgot about you. Pester me and I'll add you.\n",d=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,l.jsx)(a.rU,(0,i.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Mehdi Teymorian",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(a.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(o(),{source:c,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
